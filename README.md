# Secrets-App

This App Stores secrets of people anonymously. this app is mostly based on Authentication and security module.
I have explored 6 levels of authentication & security while buiding this project.
mainly:
1) Register Users with username and password
2) Database encryption adn using enviromental variables
3) hasing passwords
4) Salting and hashing passwords with bcrypt
5) Using Passport.js to add cookies and sessions
6) Oauth 2.0 and how to Implement sign in with google

learnt lot of things related to authentication and security such as how to use passport.js, plugins , sessions and cookies.
